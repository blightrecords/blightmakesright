	BR'ER initially began as the solo recording project of Philadelphia native Benjamin Schurr as a means of completing several unfinished songs. From these beginnings Br'er quickly became its own entity, growing into an ever shifting lineup of musicians culled from across the Philadelphia area to help bring Schurr's dense experimental pop compositions to life.

	From swamp to shining swamp BRUISEY PEETS (Ben Usie) gurgles and pulses with his unique brand of noisy electronic pop. Originally from Lafayette LA, Usie has been a DC transplant for most of a decade playing in bands such as Pree and Br’er while also directing music videos for several DC bands. Political yet confessional, Bruisey Peets utilizes samplers, murky delays, analog synths and an old reel to reel 8 track recorder to create sonic landscapes over which to croon.

	STRONGER SEX plays music that is equal parts emotional as it is futuristic, some kind of tender cocktail that swings between both the profoundly human as well as the fantastically unreal.

	Multi-instrumentalist Austin Gallas delivers rich vocal harmonies, complex arrangements created with both electronic and non-electronic hardware, as well as a certain open-ended writing style.

	REIGHNBEAU concoct hypnotic tracks that shift and sift, like sand through fingers, tumbling through with an odd satisfaction and surreal beauty, as you interact with thousands of grains of ancient earth and animals, grinded into silt after billions of years. Based in Albuquerque, New Mexico, REIGHNBEAU is the work of visual and sound artist Bryce Hample and his Lovely Friends who include Colleen Johnson, Madeline Johnston,  Hannah daney, and James Sturgis.

	Tölva (Icelandic for computer) is the pseudonym for both the machine and the man who runs it; DC electronic-wizard Erik Sleight (Br'er, Stronger Sex, CrushnPain, Joy Buttons, Jauze). Tapping both vintage and futuristic sounds, Sleight marries analog electronics, volcanic beats and mangled samples to craft a unique sonic tundra.
